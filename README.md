#SFML Game Development Training

This repository is a collection of training projects and experiments focused on learning game development and graphical user interface (GUI) programming using the C++ SFML library. Itâ€™s not a formal game or project, but rather a learning space to explore and practice.

##About

***The main goal of this repository is to:***

- *** Learn game development concepts** such as game loops, input handling, rendering, physics, and more.

- ***Understand and utilize the SFML library*** for 2D game development and GUI functionalities.

- ***Experiment and practice*** building small games and interactive applications.

This repository serves as a sandbox to:

- Experiment with different game mechanics.

- Explore the features and capabilities of SFML.

- Improve C++ programming skills in the context of game development.
